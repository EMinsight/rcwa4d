# rcwa4d

This is an electromagnetic solver based on Rigorous Coupled Wave Analyses (RCWA) for layered structures with incommensurate periodicities. It can be used to obtain the scattering properties (e.g. transmission, reflection, diffractions) in such structures.

The theory and preliminary results of this method are described in [this paper](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.136101).

The results obtained from this method has matched well to experiments in [microwave domain](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add4339) and [optical domain](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh8498).

This package has also been used for applications such as [tunable filter](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsphotonics.1c01263).
